## **Make the Netherlands AI‑savvy**

AI literacy is essential for everyone, not just specialists. From students to seniors, everyone should understand what AI is, how it works and how to use it. That demands investment in education at every level and ongoing retraining for the workforce.

Launch a national campaign to make the Netherlands AI‑savvy, highlighting both the possibilities and the risks. Organise hackathons where people, supported by experts, learn to use AI in their work. Make AI training mandatory for civil servants and encourage companies to actively adopt AI. Even if we do not develop the best AI ourselves, we must excel at applying it.
