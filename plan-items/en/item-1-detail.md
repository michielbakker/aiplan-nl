## **AI sovereignty**

We need Dutch companies that do more than build AI apps—they have to train and adapt models themselves. These firms should supply essential systems for our government, defence and industry. The French recognised this early and now have three AI start-ups valued at over €10 billion. One of them, Mistral, launched "Le Chat", a direct rival to ChatGPT.

Sovereignty means owning the technology that underpins our future. It's not just about using AI but also about understanding, developing and controlling it. Critical systems that keep society running should rely on technology we fully comprehend and can shape.
