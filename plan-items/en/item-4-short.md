### **Strategic investments**

We invest in young start-ups but lack the growth capital to really scale them. Decide which sectors we cannot afford to lose and channel more funding there. If we put less than 0.1% of our pension assets into innovation, the other 99.9% may ultimately fall short for our pensions.
