## **Research AI impact**

Start a national programme to examine how AI affects the economy, education, democracy and security. Link researchers with policymakers and companies so they can develop scenarios that feed directly into policy and strategy.

We must invest not just in the technology itself but also in understanding its societal consequences. That requires multidisciplinary research where technologists, social scientists, ethicists and lawyers work together to map and steer the many facets of AI's impact.
