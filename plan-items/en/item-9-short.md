### **Research AI impact**

Launch a national programme to study the impact of AI on the economy, education, democracy and security. Establish a dedicated AI impact institute that links scientists, policymakers and companies and develops scenarios for AI transitions in education, healthcare, defence and democracy. This research should not just analyse but also help steer national policy.
