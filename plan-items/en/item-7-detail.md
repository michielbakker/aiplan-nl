## **Sector-specific AI plans**

For sectors where reliance on foreign AI models is unacceptable we need a clear plan. We must look ahead and imagine how radically industries will change once AI reaches (super)human intelligence, and how we can contribute ourselves—in European cooperation where possible. Ambitious plans like these also attract top-tier experts keen to make a difference.

Every sector has its own challenges and opportunities. For healthcare, agriculture, logistics, education and public services we should develop specific strategies tailored to their needs. These plans must include concrete goals for building and deploying Dutch AI solutions.

Take a practical example: if we want greener farming, robots could make it possible to grow and harvest mixed crops—something traditional tractors can't handle. Such mixed cultivation is far better for the ecosystem.

Government and business must proactively set the AI agenda and make funding available. Bring together a select group of leading AI scientists and successful entrepreneurs to shape the plans. They should be people top talent wants to work with and who know how to tackle big challenges with small teams. The talent will follow when we show we have the right leaders, bold ambitions and enough resources.
