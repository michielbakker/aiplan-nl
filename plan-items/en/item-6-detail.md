## **Defense as a flywheel**

Modern defence soon won't exist without AI. We must develop our own autonomous weapons, running on models we fully control—not on American or Chinese systems that could be disabled remotely.

Defence spending can be a catalyst for broader technological progress, just as it was for the internet and GPS. Focused investment in defence AI will create an ecosystem of companies and expertise that also enables civilian applications. Strategic autonomy in this field is vital for national security.

Government should set ambitious goals and act as an immediate customer. One example is to develop low‑cost autonomous submarines costing €500,000 each. Set aside the budget for anyone who can build them. With half a billion euros we could keep tabs on every Russian vessel.
