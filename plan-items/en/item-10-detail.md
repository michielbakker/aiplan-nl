## **Online safety**

The rise of superintelligent AI will inevitably create greater security risks for society. It increases our vulnerability to sabotage, misinformation, espionage and ever more sophisticated digital attacks. We must not just acknowledge these risks but tackle them proactively.

The Netherlands needs major investment in AI safety and cyber resilience, building expertise both technically and operationally. Close cooperation with EU partners is vital so we can together establish robust standards for responsible AI use.

ASML makes the Netherlands indispensable in the global AI chainâ€”but that also makes us vulnerable. This strategic position demands targeted security measures to protect our national interests as guarding against malicious AI use becomes a central part of national security.
