## **A Dutch AI hub**

Silicon Valley thrives thanks to a critical mass of capital and talent. Europe will never have a Silicon Valley of its own, but we do have well-connected cities like Amsterdam where expertise can be concentrated.

To draw in AI talent and capital the Netherlands should create a single central hub, modelled on France's "Station F". It would host year-round meetups, give major tech companies space for AI research and provide a home for start-ups.

A physical location where talent, capital, and ideas come together accelerates innovation exponentially. This hub should be open to both startups and established companies.
