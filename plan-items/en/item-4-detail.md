## **Strategic investments**

While the United States and China pour money into winners, we spread our resources too thin. We invest in many early-stage companies but when real growth capital is needed to scale up, we fall hopelessly short. We must be bold: decide which sectors we simply have to keep and finance them properly.

Dutch pension funds manage over â‚¬1.7 trillion yet invest only a sliver of that in innovation. Even a small shift toward strategic AI investments could have enormous impact without jeopardising the pension system. If we invest less than 0.1% of our vast pension pot in innovation, the other 99.9% may end up worth too little for our retirement.
