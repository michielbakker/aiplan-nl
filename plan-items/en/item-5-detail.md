## **European compute power**

Computing power is the fuel of AI development; whoever controls it decides who can access advanced AI capabilities. The Netherlands should therefore invest, with the rest of Europe, in its own chip production and AI supercomputers on European soil. ASML's expertise puts us in a unique position to lead.

Because AI consumes huge amounts of energy, we must vastly expand solar, wind and nuclear capacity to keep pace in an AI-driven future.
